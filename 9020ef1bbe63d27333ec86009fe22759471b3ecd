      "message": "I look at the logs that zuulv3 has sent. This published to a production site the changes before they were code-reviewed and accepted. Wouldn\u0027t it be better to change `playbooks/publish-infra-doc/tasks/main.yaml` to publish to a subdirectory \u003cchangeset\u003e,\u003cpatchset\u003e when you see you are in `check` or `gate`?\n\nProduction site should ideally  be updated in `post-merge` if this pipeline works. There are `zuul.*` ansible vars that can be easily used, such as {{ zuul.pipeline }} to discover how was the job executed.",
