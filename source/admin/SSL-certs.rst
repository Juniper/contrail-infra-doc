SSL certs

review.opencontrail.org
-----------------------

Certificate for https://review.opencontrail.org was issued by Let's Encrypt CA with use of certbot.

It was something like `set&forget`, because cert is auto-renewed by certbot run periodically by cron.

The configuration was done following this instruction:

.. code:: bash

  # Installing certbot
  $ wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
  $ sudo mv certbot-auto /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto
  $ sudo chown root /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto
  $ sudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto

  # Issuing the cert and configuring Apache
  $ sudo /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto --apache

  # Setting crontab for auto-renewal
  $ echo "0 0,12 * * * root python -c 'import random; import time; time.sleep(random.random() * 3600)' && /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto renew" | sudo tee -a /etc/crontab > /dev/null
